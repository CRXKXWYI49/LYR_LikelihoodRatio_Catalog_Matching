# PythonLikelihoodRatio (LYR)
Likelihood ratio test for matching astronomical object counterparts in different wavelengths. The code was used to match the X-ray counterparts in the J1030 field, as described in Nanni et al. 2020.
If you use LYR please cite Nanni+20 and Peca+20.

## The method
Source matching between different catalogs at different wavelengths can be computed using the Likelihood-Ratio (LR) technique. For the statistical and matematical background of the procedure, described firstly by Sutherland and Saunders 1992, we refer to e.g., Zamorani et al. 1999; Ciliegi et al. 2003; Brusa et al. 2007; Luo et al. 2010.

A very preliminary draft of the manual can be read and downloaded in the repository.
